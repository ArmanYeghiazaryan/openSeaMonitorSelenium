# OpenSea.io Selenium Monitor 

- this is a basic OpenSea-Monitor script, which sends you a Discord-Webhook once a new NFT has been posted for your desired collection.
- It will launch a selenium browser and monitor your collection. The webhook will contain basic information like floor price, nft price, item number, img url and much more...
- It's not adviced to use this script, as selenium monitors are great for alpha testing, however not fast enough to get reliable results. See it as inspiration.
