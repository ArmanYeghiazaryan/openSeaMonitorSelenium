Hi,

this is a basic OpenSea-Monitor script, which sends you a Discord-Webhook once a new NFT has been posted for your desired collection.

It will launch a selenium browser and monitor your collection. The webhook will contain basic information like floor price, nft price, item number, img url and much more...

It's not adviced to use this script, as selenium monitors are great for alpha testing, however not fast enough to get reliable results. See it as inspiration. 

Enjoy!

PS: Please bear in mind, that this was a private project and has not seen an update for a long time now.
